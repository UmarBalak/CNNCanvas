# CNNCanvas
CNNCanvas is an interactive tool for building and analyzing Convolutional Neural Networks. Add layers manually, tweak parameters (filters, strides, pooling, etc.), and analyze output shapes and model size in real-time. Future updates will include feature map visualizations, prebuilt architectures, and export options for TensorFlow/Pytorch models.
